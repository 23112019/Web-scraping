# Web-scraping
- 
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites, and Python provides a variety of powerful libraries to accomplish this task. This introduction covers key tools and techniques for web scraping using Python:

BeautifulSoup (bs4): A popular library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data easily [1].

Requests: A simple and elegant HTTP library for Python, making it easy to send HTTP requests to fetch web pages for scraping [2].

Selenium: A powerful tool for browser automation, allowing you to interact with web pages as if you were a human user. Selenium is useful for scraping dynamic content that requires JavaScript execution [3].

JSON: A lightweight data-interchange format. When web data is available in JSON format, parsing it becomes straightforward using Python's built-in JSON module.

XPath: A language for navigating XML documents. It allows for precise location of elements within an XML document, which is useful for extracting specific data points.

Playwright: A newer library for browser automation, providing capabilities similar to Selenium but with additional features and improved performance.

These tools together enable robust and flexible web scraping solutions, from simple static page scraping to complex dynamic content extraction and browser automation.
